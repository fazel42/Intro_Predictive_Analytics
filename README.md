# Intro_Predictive_Analytics
This repository has the total summation of various methods I have tried to learn implementation of modeling algorithms in Python. The data sets used are from Kaggle. 
I have listed down the data sources used in the corresponding ipynb files for this purpose - 
1. File 'Cancer_Prediction_Benign_Malignant.ipynb' is my attempt at solving the prediction problem from Kaggle - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data
2. File 'UCI_Cars_Dataset' is my attempt at solving the prediction problem from UCI data set - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
3. File 'Mail_classification_Spam' is my attempt in solving the spam classification problem from the UCI data set - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase using different modeling techniques
